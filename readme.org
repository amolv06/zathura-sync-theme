* zathura-sync-theme

This package allows you to synchronize Zathura's theme with Emacs for seamless PDF reading. Changing your emacs theme will automatically change your Zathura theme. It was heavily inspired by this [[https://blog.akaisuisei.org/communicating-with-zathura-via-dbus.html][blog post]] by mafty.

** Preview

The left two windows are pdf documents open in zathura.

** Installation:

Clone this repository and run ~package-install-file~ on ~zathura-sync-theme.el~. Ensure that recolor is set in Zathura. Enable ~zathura-sync-theme-mode~ and you're good to go. I'm hoping to get this on Melpa soon.
