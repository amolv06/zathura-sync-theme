* zathura-sync-theme

This package allows you to synchronize Zathura's theme with Emacs for seamless PDF reading. Changing your emacs theme will automatically change your Zathura theme. It was heavily inspired by this [[https://blog.akaisuisei.org/communicating-with-zathura-via-dbus.html][blog post]] by mafty.

** Installation:

Clone this repository and run ~package-install-file~ on ~zathura-sync-theme.el~. Enable ~zathura-sync-theme-mode~. It will write theme colors to =zathura-theme-config= (defaults to =~/.config/zathura/theme=). Make sure you include this file in =zathurarc=. When a new theme gets enabled, the =theme= file would be overwritten and =zathura= processes would be instructed to reload config over D-Bus. I'm hoping to get this on Melpa soon.
